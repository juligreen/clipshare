== What is this?

clipshare is a simple self-hosted website.

It receives text and shares this text with everyone else looking at the site.

I intend to use it to play Visual Novels in Japanese with friends so I can share the game's text with them easily.

Therefore it is intended to be used with https://github.com/kmltml/clipboard-inserter
